# NextJS with Redux

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [React-Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) and [Redux-Toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit).

This boilerplate is created for myself so I'm not claiming that this is a production ready boilerplate.

## Getting Started

Before run the development server, remove `_(dash)` from `_.env.local` then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

When you run the development server, it will also run an API which uses Next API Routes for Redux examples.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/examples](http://localhost:3000/api/examples). These endpoints can be edited in `pages/api/examples`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
